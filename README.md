# Tower of Babel

Tower of Babel is a game I am creating for my own amusement, based on the excellent steampunk series, The Books of Babel by Josiah Bancroft.  I have no intention of selling or distributing the game in any way.  The Books of Babel are among my favorite books, and one common complaint I have heard is that they are too episodic, with chunks of each book taking place in a new miniworld with new characters, settings, and political machinations at work, with a core cast of characters that may or may not all be together at once.  It's a bit like a long-running sci-fi show, or ....an RPG.  Once I realized the plot would make a perfect RPG story, I knew I would have to build this game one day.

This is my first foray into game development, so it's a learning experience.

## Assets

The assets I am using in the game are purchased from or distributed for free by the owners.  I am not including the files in this repo since I do not have permission to do so.  

## No Distribution 

I am not including a .love file here because I don't have permission from all assets artists to distribute a game with their materials, or from Josiah Bancroft to distribute a game based on his novels.
