# Tower of Babel

Tower of Babel is a game I am creating for my own amusement, based on the excellent steampunk series, The Books of Babel by Josiah Bancroft.  I have no intention of selling or distributing the game in any way.  The Books of Babel are among my favorite books, and one common complaint I have heard is that they are too episodic, with chunks of each book taking place in a new miniworld with new characters, settings, and political machinations at work, with a core cast of characters that may or may not all be together at once.  It's a bit like a long-running sci-fi show, or ....an RPG.  Once I realized the plot would make a perfect RPG story, I knew I would have to build this game one day.

This is my first foray into game development, so it's a learning experience.

## Assets

The assets I am using in the game are purchased from or distributed for free by the owners.  I am not including the files in this repo since I do not have permission to do so.  

## No Distribution 

I am not including a .love file here because I don't have permission from all assets artists to distribute a game with their materials.  I also do not have permission from Josiah Bancroft to use his story and characters, although there is no reference to the books in the codebase beyond the name "Tom" and the title.  I will need to make the repo private when I start drawing actual content from the story, but for now it's just creativity inspiration.
